# Static Delivery Data

This repo will be used for another [project](https://github.com/paolo-05/comunicazione-aziendale) for delivering videos and images. The concept is very simple: a simple API in python using the Flask library and the Nginx web server. The API exposes a endpoint for uploading files. Nginx exposes the uploads folder.
